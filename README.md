# Cafe-Of-Exchange

This project is a Stock Cafe System where coffee prices fluctuate based on user demand. The system is coded in Java and utilizes a live PostgreSQL database. There are three different GUI designs catering to different user roles: Cashier, Customer, and Manager.

### Features

- **Dynamic Pricing**: Coffee prices increase as demand rises and decrease as demand falls.
- **Role-Based GUIs**: Three distinct graphical user interfaces for Cashier, Customer, and Manager.
- **Live Database**: Integration with a live PostgreSQL server for real-time data management.

### User Interfaces

1. **Cashier GUI**: Designed for cashiers to process orders and handle transactions efficiently.
2. **Customer GUI**: Allows customers to place orders and view the current price of coffee based on demand.
3. **Manager GUI**: Provides managers with tools to monitor sales, demand trends, and adjust settings as needed.

### Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (live server)

### How It Works

- **Price Adjustment**: The price of coffee is dynamically adjusted based on real-time demand. As more customers place orders, the price of coffee increases. Conversely, when demand decreases, the price falls.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The system is connected to a live PostgreSQL database, ensuring that all data is up-to-date and accurate.

### Usage

- **Cashier**: Use the Cashier GUI to manage orders and transactions.
- **Customer**: Use the Customer GUI to place orders and view current prices.
- **Manager**: Use the Manager GUI to monitor sales and manage demand-based pricing strategies.
